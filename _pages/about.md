### Bio
I'm a PhD student at the [Computational and Biological Learning Lab](https://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge supervised by [Adrian Weller](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and advised by [José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). I'm also a visiting student at the [Cocosci group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/), MIT.

I obtained my [MSc in CS](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/MSCinCS/) conducting research with the [Visual Geometry Group](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at Oxford, and I was awarded [BSc in AI](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/utaintl.htm) with *Class Prize for Top Performance* at Edinburgh University.

### Interests
Broadly, I am interested in driving substantial advancements in humanity's development. To this end, my research focuses on developing embodied, generally intelligent agents [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) and understanding human intelligence.

Concretely, my work involves expanding the foundation and scope of **probabilistic, differentiable programming** and **program synthesis** which builds on:

- *probabilistic modelling and inference* for managing uncertainty;
- *neural networks* for pattern recognition, amortization;
- *symbolic languages* for knowledge representation;

and leverages principles such as causality, compositionality and hierarchy.

Beyond this, I like to seek truth and beauty as they are found in nature, maths, and art.
