### Bio
I am an [MSc student in Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/msc-computer-science/) at University of Oxford and 
a visiting student at [Prof. Josh Tenenbaum's lab](https://cocosci.mit.edu/).

Previously, I was awarded [BSc in Artificial Intelligence](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/utaintl.htm) with Class Prize for Top Performance (highest average grade) at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics).

### Interests
Boradly, I am interested in significantly advancing the development of humankind by pushing the frontier of scientific understanding and engineering. To this end, I research towards [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence).

More specifically, I investigate in the complementary goals of building more human-like machine 
learning systems and better understanding human learning. 
To this end, I want to expand the foundation and scope of the probabilistic, neurosymbolic toolkit.
This synthesizes from and builds on generations
of AI research: **probabilistic inference** for managing uncertainty, **neural networks**
for pattern recognition, amortized inference, **symbolic languages** for abstract knowledge representation,
**causal reasoning** for explainability and control, and **hierarchical inference**
for learning to learn. Based on these methods, I'm particularly interested in the following topics:
- Neural Program Induction (Learning to Program), Program Synthesis.
- Differentiable, Probabilistic Programming; Latent Variable Models.

And their applications in: Visual, Language Understanding and Generation, Control, Concept Learning, and Theory Induction.

Outside of this, I like to seek for truth and beauty as they are found in nature, math, and art.
