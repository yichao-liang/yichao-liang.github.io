### Bio
I'm a PhD student at the [Computational and Biological Learning Lab (CBL)](https://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/), Cambridge supervised by [Adrian Weller](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and advised by [José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). I collaborate closely with amazing people from the [Computational Cognitive Science group (CoCoSci)](https://cocosci.mit.edu/) at MIT and the [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at Oxford.

I obtained [MSc in Advanced Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/MSCinCS/) from Oxford, and I was awarded [BSc in AI](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/utaintl.htm) with *Class Prize for Top Performance* from Edinburgh University.

### Interests
Broadly, I am interested in driving substantial advancements in humanity's development. To this end, my research focuses on the complementary goals of developing generally competent embodied agents ([AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)) and understanding human intelligence.


Concretely, my work involves expanding the foundation and scope of **probabilistic, differentiable programming** and **program synthesis** which builds on:

- *probabilistic modelling and inference* for managing uncertainty;
- *neural networks* for pattern recognition, amortization;
- *symbolic languages* for knowledge representation;

and leverages principles such as causality, compositionally, and hierarchy.

Beyond this, I like to seek truth and beauty as they are found in nature, maths, and art.
