### Bio
I am an [MSc student in Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/msc-computer-science/) at University of Oxford and 
a visiting student at [Prof. Josh Tenenbaum's lab](https://cocosci.mit.edu/) at MIT.

Previously, I was awarded [BSc in Artificial Intelligence](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/utaintl.htm) with Class Prize for Top Performance (highest average grade) at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics).

### Interests
Broadly, I am interested in significantly advancing the development of mankind by pushing the frontier of scientific understanding and engineering. To this end, I research in building more human-like machine intelligence and better understanding human intelligence, for creating [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence).

More specifically, I work on expanding the foundation and scope of ***the probabilistic, neuro-symbolic toolkit***, building agents that we can communicate with and solve any problem we pose at them -- write programs; understand percepts, language; take rational actions...

The toolkit mainly includes **probabilistic, differentiable programming** and **program synthesis** that build on:
- *probabilistic inference* for managing uncertainty;
- *neural networks* for pattern recognition, amortized inference;
- *programming languages* for knowledge representation;

and leverages principles such as causality, compositionality and hierarchy.

Outside of this, I like to seek for truth and beauty as they are found in nature, maths, and art.
