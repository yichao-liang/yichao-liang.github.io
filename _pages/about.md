### Bio
I am an [MSc student in Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/msc-computer-science/) at University of Oxford and 
a visiting student at [Prof. Josh Tenenbaum's lab](https://cocosci.mit.edu/) at MIT.

Previously, I was awarded [BSc in Artificial Intelligence](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/utaintl.htm) with Class Prize for Top Performance (highest average grade) at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics).

### Interests
Boradly, I am interested in significantly advancing the development of mankind by pushing the frontier of scientific understanding and engineering. To this end, I research in [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), 
i.e., building more human-like machine intelligence systems and better understanding human intelligence.

More specifically, I work on expanding the foundation and scope of the probabilistic, neuro-symbolic toolkit for learning and reasoning, with application such as program induction; scene, language understanding; control; concept learning.

The toolkit builds on:
- ***probabilistic inference*** for managing uncertainty,
- ***neural networks*** for pattern recognition, amortized inference,
- ***symbolic languages*** for knowledge representation,
leveraging principals such as compositionality, causality and hierarchy.

Outside of this, I like to seek for truth and beauty as they are found in nature, maths, and art.
