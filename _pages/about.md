### Bio
I'm a PhD student at the [Computational and Biological Learning Lab (CBL)](https://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at Cambridge, supervised by [Adrian Weller](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and advised by [Carl Edward Rasmussen](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl/) and [José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). I also collaborate with incredible researchers from Basis, MIT, Cornell, Princeton, Google, and Oxford.

I obtained an [MSc in Advanced Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/MSCinCS/) from Oxford, and a [BSc in AI](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/utaintl.htm) from Edinburgh, where I graduated top of my cohort.

### Interests
I am broadly interested in driving substantial advancements in humanity's development. To this end, I pursue the complementary goals of developing generally capable embodied agents ([AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)) and understanding human intelligence, by creating agents that better combine learning and reasoning, drawing on different traditions in AI research, including formal languages, probabilistic modeling, and machine learning.

Beyond this, I like to seek truth and beauty as they are found in nature, maths, and arts.
